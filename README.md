### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You may want to checkout my projects:

- [Ccache](https://github.com/yfractal/ccache) is a multi-language client-side caching library.

  Ccache explores ways to pull caches from remote servers to local and uses Rust to support different languages, such as Ruby and Go (in development).

- [SDB](https://github.com/yfractal/sdb) is a Ruby stack profiler without GVL.

  SDB releases the GVL to avoid blocking application execution and its scanner offloads unnecessary work to improve performance.

- [otel-snitch](https://github.com/yfractal/otel-snitch) shares memory between the otel-rb client and the otel-collector to reduce RPC costs.

  otel-snitch is an experimental project aimed at avoiding serialization and network costs when the otel-client and otel-collector are on the same machine by using shared memory directly.
- Others
  - [cpu-time](https://github.com/yfractal/cpu_time) is a simple Ruby Gem for measuring CPU time.
  - [elder-wand/https](https://github.com/yfractal/elder-wand/tree/main/https) is an experimental project for capturing HTTPS plaintext without a CA certificate and root right using Dylib injection.
