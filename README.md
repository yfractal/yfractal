### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You may want to checkout my projects:

- [Ccache](https://github.com/yfractal/ccache) is a multi-language client-side caching library.

  Ccache explores ways to pull caches from remote servers to local and uses Rust to support different languages, such as Ruby and Go (in development).

- [SDB](https://github.com/yfractal/sdb) is a Ruby stack profiler without GVL.

  SDB releases the GVL to avoid blocking application execution and its scanner offloads unnecessary work to improve performance.

- [otel-snitch](https://github.com/yfractal/otel-snitch) shares memory between the otel-rb client and the otel-receiver to reduce RPC costs.

  otel-snitch is an experimental project aimed at avoiding serialization and network costs when the Otel client and collector are on the same machine by using shared memory directly.
